For a shortcut, you can just download the `app-debug.apk` and run that using `adb install app-debug.apk`.

If you want to look at the code, maybe even change it, you can use `git clone ...` to clone the repository or use `Code -> Download ZIP`.
Make sure to delete the `app-debug.apk` file after cloning or downloading (optional but recommended).
